            <h2>Lore</h2>
            <p>Humanity in 2013 is plagued by a fungus called Cordyceps, which spread from South America via grain.
             For unknown reasons, the fungus began to mutate, taking control not only of insects, as usual, but also of humans. 
             Millions, if not billions, have died from the aggressive fungus, while others have been transformed into fearsome monsters. 
             Only a handful of survivors survive, yet their lives are tied to the constant threat of infection, starvation, and competition with other survivors. 
             Most towns are abandoned, and the survivors fight among themselves for food and other vital resources. 
             It's in this environment that The Last of Us is set - a man with a hazy past named Joel and a girl named Ellie.
